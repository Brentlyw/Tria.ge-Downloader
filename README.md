# Tria.ge-Downloader
An automatic Tria.ge sample downloader, defined by family name. To make collection of families easier for all!

# What does it do?
1.) Python launches a selenium browser instance to Tria.ge, requiring you to log in.
2.) Program autosaves your csrf and auth token to a local config for future use.  
3.) You provide family name you want to download.  
4.) Program autodownloads the most recent 200 samples to ./downloads/{family-name}/  

Enjoy :-)
